# AHK Macro Pad

This repo is a collection of Auto Hot Key Scripts to use a cheap USB Numpad as a macro pad/keyboard.

This is the one I have:

[[https://github.com/JGM-Ramalho/AHKMacroPad/blob/e8d0b016ab18c9f14a5899014735a309fa4f3c34/docs/img/NGS-USB-numpad.jpg|alt="USBNumpad"]]

In order to separate the key strokes from each of the keyboards I use [AutoHotInterception](https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception).

Although I have it bundled with the repo, you have to follow its [install instructions](https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception#setup) for the Interception Driver (Just step 1 is enough) before using this script

I also have a basic VSCode workspace setup to help with developing the AHK Scripts.
