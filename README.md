# AHK Macro Pad

This repo is a collection of Auto Hot Key Scripts to use a cheap USB Numpad as a macro pad/keyboard.

In order to separate the key strokes from each of the keyboards I use [AutoHotInterception](https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception)

I also have a basic VSCode workspace setup to help with developing the AHK Scripts.
